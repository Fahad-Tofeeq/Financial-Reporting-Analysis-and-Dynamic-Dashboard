# Financial-Reporting-Analysis-and-Dynamic-Dashboard
I teamed up with a awesome corporate client to whip up a slick Advanced Excel reporting system and a super interactive dashboard! The financial reports I put together break down all the big metrics in a fun, easy way. The dashboard’s got cool KPI cards that give you quick financial vibes, all hooked up to slicers for instant updates. Plus, the graphs and charts—linked to those slicers—shift smoothly with every change, making data pop like magic. I dove into the numbers to pull out neat insights that boost business moves. Check out the report and dashboard are attached—they’re worth a peek!
